# hello-world


Hi there,

I am learning how to use git and git-hub, this is my first exercise. I hope to become the best gitter in the galaxy or at least in my neighbourhood. This is a first step, totally insignificant for the world, but very big for me. Some day I hope to look back at this text and be happy and satisfied with the progress made, maybe even contemplate on how the world has changed since. :D Peace

Stefan
